        <p>At The Bone Graft Consortium , we 
            lift the veil of mismanaged, 
            misrepresented, and misunderstood 
            grafting categories so HCPs can easily 
            and quickly make an informed decision. 
            With seats on our board filled by 
            executives from major grafting 
            manufacturers, KOLs, insurance providers,
             as well as small, biologic only companies, the BGC is the only 
             completely comprehensive resource demanded by hospital systems and 
             providers alike, in order to make an informed decision based on facts, 
             not marketing, for best practices and patient specific needs.</p>
